## Intuition

We solve this problem with dynamic programming using a 2-dim matrix, where m[left][right] denotes the maximal gains we can obtain if the sequence of coins is s_{left} , ... , s_{right}. If it is our turn we try to maximize the outcome knowing all outcomes of sequences that are of one coin less. If our opponent plays we need to assume that it chooses a strategy that will minimize our gains. In the case of our turn we always have to add up the gains received by extending the sequence to one element either on the left or the right.
