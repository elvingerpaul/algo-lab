tags: Maximum Flow

## Intuition
Even though it might seem intially like a max flow min cost problem, we can solve it only using a maxflow problem. Note that we're only interested in minimizin our cost and don't care how many cuts we have to do for it. We will therefore scale each cut by its actual cost. The question that remains to be solved is what is going to be the source and sink of our network. For this note that since each partition in the end needs to hold at least one figure. One partition thus needs to hold figure 0 and one of the n-1 remaining figures for sure needs to be in the other partition. We could thus choose 0 to be our source and try out all other n-1 nodes as our sink and consider for which pair we get the smallest maximum flow. Note that the cuts are not symmetric which is why for a given pair of nodes (0,i) we need to consider the scenarios (src = 0, sink = i) as well as (src = i, sink = 0). This results in calling the max_flow funciton 2*(n-1) times. This solution is sufficient to pass all test cases.

There is a trick how we can call the max_flow function only n times instead. The trick is to consider all figures to be organized in a circle and always choose a given figure to be the soruce and consecutive figure to be the sink. Since we loop around and especially because in this matter the node 0 will once be src (src = 0, sink = 1) and once be the destination (src = n-1, sink = 0), we are guaranteed to have all scenarios covered.
