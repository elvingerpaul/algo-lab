# Algolab 2023
This code contains my solutions for the ETH course [Algorithms Lab in Fall 2023](https://cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS23/algolab/index.html). Problem statements as well as input data are not included at this point. Inspiration for repo setup as well as some problem explanations was taken from [this](https://github.com/haeggee/algolab) and [this](https://github.com/simon-hrabec/algolab-2020) person. Please don't consider this repo as a source of truth for the different problems but rather as an inspiration. If you find any bugs, improvements or something worth mentioning, feel free to reach out. Feedback is always welcome.

Code requires C++, CGAL, BGL. See https://cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS23/algolab/technical.html.
