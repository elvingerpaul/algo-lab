# Algolab 2023
This code contains my solutions for the ETH course [Algorithms Lab in Fall 2023](https://cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS23/algolab/index.html). Problem statements as well as input data are not included at this point. Inspiration for repo setup and some problem explanations were taken from [this](https://github.com/haeggee/algolab) and [this](https://github.com/simon-hrabec/algolab-2020) person. I try to provide some insights on top, in particular to the problems I struggled with or found non-trivial. So please consider this repo more as an inspiration rather than a source of truth. If you find any bugs, improvements or something worth mentioning, feel free to reach out. Feedback is always welcome.

Code requires C++, CGAL, BGL. See https://cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS23/algolab/technical.html.
